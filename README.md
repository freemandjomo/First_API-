# Raw Node.js API Concept.

This is a fundamental project to understand how HTTP servers, Routing, and JSON responses work in Node.js **without using any frameworks** like Express.

## What I learned
- Creating a server with the `http` module.
- Handling Request and Response streams.
- Manual Routing logic using `if/else`.
- Setting HTTP Headers (`Content-Type: application/json`).
- Sending JSON data to the client.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `node server.js`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/goal`
